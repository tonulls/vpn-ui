// The overview is gated by TWO bits that must not collapse into one another.
//
// PermOverviewManage is an AND on top of each action's own permission, never a
// substitute for it and never satisfied by it. Both halves are pinned here because
// each is a different way to get the gate wrong: drop the new bit and the overview
// goes back to offering management to anyone who can log in, drop the old one and a
// single new checkbox silently hands out Xray and panel-settings rights.
//
// PermAccessOverview gates the page itself, which is only possible because a denial
// now resolves a reachable landing page instead of redirecting to the overview. Its
// cases pin both ends of that: who is refused, and that the refusal never points
// back at the page that just refused them.
//
// A real request through a real router, for the reason idor_test.go gives: the
// middleware in isolation proves nothing about what the route table actually wired.

// forbiddenKey is what a refusal says. Asserting on the BODY rather than the status
// is not a shortcut: deny() answers XHR with HTTP 200 and success:false on purpose,
// because axios rejects any non-2xx and the frontend would show its own "Request
// failed with status code 403" instead of the reason (see the comment on deny). A
