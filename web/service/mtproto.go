// MtprotoService manages the MTProto Proxy (Telegram) protocol, backed by the
// bundled `telemt` daemon: one process per inbound, like ocserv and accel-ppp.
//
// MTProto is the ODD ONE OUT among the VPN protocols and the differences are
// load-bearing, so they are spelled out here rather than discovered later:
//
//   - It is a userspace TCP RELAY, not a tunnel. There is no ppp0/tun0, no kernel
//     module, no nftables rule, and CRUCIALLY no per-client tunnel IP. Every other
//     VPN protocol hands each device an IP out of 10.N.0.0/16 and that IP is the
//     session-registry key, the nft counter key, and the Xray routing key. MTProto
//     has none of that, so it deliberately does NOT touch vpnrange.go, does NOT get
//     a protocolBase, and does NOT go through the rbridge/nft accounting path. That
//     path would fail SILENTLY (AddClientAccounting discards every nft error and
//     returns nil), leaving accounts that look online and bill zero forever.
//
//   - Accounting comes from telemt's own per-user counters, scraped off its
//     loopback Prometheus endpoint (telemt_user_octets_from_client / _to_client)
//     and folded straight into client_traffics. No IP is involved.
//
//   - User Limit is enforced BY telemt (user_max_unique_ips counts distinct client
//     source IPs per account), not by the panel's K-consecutive-IPs allocator. So
//     there is no rbridge Adapter here: nothing to poll, nothing to evict. The
//     "strategy" (reject vs accept-evict-oldest) is not configurable: telemt
//     rejects the excess device.
//
//   - Xray routing works via the inbound TAG and the socks USERNAME, not source IPs:
//     the panel injects a loopback socks inbound tagged with inbound.Tag
//     (GetSocksConfig) and points telemt's [[upstreams]] at it, so operator rules
//     match this inbound exactly like every other one. Per-CLIENT rules work too,
//     but by a different carrier: telemt presents the authenticated account as the
//     RFC1929 socks username, which Xray turns into inbound.User.Email for the
//     `user` matcher. That is why mtproto is intentionally absent from
//     BuildVpnEmailToIPMap's allowlist: it needs no email-to-IP translation, having
//     no IP to translate.
//
//   - adtag and Xray routing are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, and this is Telegram's design,
//     not a gap in telemt. adtag requires middle-proxy mode, whose RPC session key
//     is derived from the proxy's own egress IP *and port* (aes_create_keys bakes
//     client_ip/client_port into the KDF; both sides derive it independently). Any
//     TCP-terminating proxy (socks5, VLESS, TUN-via-gvisor) re-originates the
//     connection with a new source port, so the keys disagree and the handshake
//     fails. telemt can recover the true tuple from a SOCKS5 BND reply, but Xray's
//     socks server answers with its OWN listen address (proxy/socks/protocol.go:
//     responseAddress = s.address), which telemt classifies as a bogon. We therefore
//     never set an upstream while adtag is on, and pin me_socks_kdf_policy=strict so
//     the failure is loud rather than a silently untagged proxy.

//
//   - [censorship].tls_domain models ONE domain's real certificate for the whole
//     process, so the old firstTlsDomain() collapsed every account's domain to the
//     first one anyway.

// back to an inbound with no modes at all, which renders empty [access.user_modes]
// entries and (per our telemt patch) grants every account every mode. This runs on the

// the two can never disagree about which inbounds still need this). A new inbound always

// [access.users] entirely, so it cannot authenticate, and nothing in the log says why.
//
// The values are chosen so the old binary computes the SAME config, not merely a valid
// one:
//
//   - modes: written explicitly, false included, so the old per-account mode map is the
//     inbound's set exactly rather than the union of whatever survived.

//     the old firstTlsDomain skip the account, and because "absent" and "" would compare
//     unequal below and turn this pass into a write on every tick.
//   - userLimit: the RAW value, so an explicit 0 still means "no limit" over there and
