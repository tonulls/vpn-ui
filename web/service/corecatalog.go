// The core catalog: what each installable VPN core actually needs from the host.
//
// Setup used to be all-or-nothing. It ran every step for every protocol, so a
// host that only ever wanted WireGuard still got pppd, accel-ppp, strongSwan and
// a kernel-modules package it had no use for. The catalog below replaces that
// with one declarative row per core, which three things then read:
//
//   - provisioning, to run only the steps the selected cores need;
//   - the system status card, so a module belonging to a core nobody installed
//     is not reported missing;
//   - uninstall, which removes a core's own artifacts and keeps every shared one
//     that a still-installed core continues to need.
//
// That last point is the reason requirements are named rather than inlined: with
// ipsec listed by BOTH l2tp and ikev2, "remove ikev2" can see that l2tp still
// claims strongSwan and leave the bundle alone.

// Provisioning features: host work that is not a kernel module or a bundled
// daemon binary. A core lists the ones it needs and the provisioner runs each
// exactly once for the whole selection, however many cores asked for it.
