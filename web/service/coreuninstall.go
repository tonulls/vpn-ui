// installed, never against what is being removed. IPsec is the case that forces
// it: L2TP and IKEv2 both stand on the one bundled strongSwan/charon, so
// removing IKEv2 while L2TP is still installed must take IKEv2's own swanctl
// connections and config root and leave the charon bundle, the /usr/lib/ipsec
// link and the daemon itself completely alone. The same arithmetic covers pppd
// (L2TP + PPTP), the PPP kernel-modules package (L2TP + PPTP), and every module
// two cores happen to share.
//
// Distro packages are never removed, matching the whole-host Uninstall policy:

// libreswan or a kernel package it installed, so it reports them as kept.
