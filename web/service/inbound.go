//
//   - The email belongs to a LIVE account: it is served on another inbound, or a
//     membership row says it is about to be. This is the ordinary multi-inbound

//     one. It is left completely untouched: its usage, quota, expiry and enable
//     flag are the customer's real state and a second membership must not restate
//     them.
//
//   - Nothing else serves the email. Then the row is an ORPHAN left by a client
//     that was deleted (a delete whose settings write landed while its row did
//     not, a case-split spelling the old exact-match delete could not find, or an
//     inbound dropped out from under it), and the client being created now is a
//     NEW customer who merely reused the name. Inheriting it is the "I deleted them
//     and recreated them and it still does not work" report: the predecessor's
//     up/down carry over, so a fresh account is born over its quota, disabled and
//     expired, with nothing in the UI explaining why. Its values are overwritten
//     with the incoming client's.
//
// The distinction lives HERE, at the one statement that can see the conflict, and
