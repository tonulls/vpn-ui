// Bulk is the one client path where the caller names their own targets. Every
// other route the reseller role touches identifies a single account in the URL,
// where a middleware can prove ownership before the handler runs; a bulk request
// carries an arbitrary list of (inbound, email) pairs in its body and
// InboundService.BulkUpdateClients trusts that list completely.
//
// So this file does two jobs, and the pricing is the second one. The first is
// SCOPING: the permission bit says a reseller may run bulk operations and the
// inbound grant says they may reach the inbound, and neither says a word about
// whose accounts are on it. Without scopeBulkTargets, one POST applies to every
// admin account on a shared inbound.
//
// The op table, and why each op is priced the way it is:
//
//	addTraffic   every surviving target gains AmountBytes, so the batch costs
//	             AmountBytes x N and the balance is checked ONCE against that
//	             total. Per-account checks would let a reseller with room for one
//	             account hand out fifty.
//	subTraffic   a refund per account, clamped at what that account has already
//	             CONSUMED and never above what it was charged. The same rule the
//	             single-account deduct runs, and literally the same code: bytes
//	             the customer already moved are gone.
//	delete       free here. The refund lands after the delete does, and only for
//	             the accounts that really went (see the controller).
//	enable, disable, freeze, unfreeze
//	             free. None of them changes a quota, so no byte moves either way.
//	             Freeze in particular is not a refund: the account keeps the quota
//	             its reseller paid for and can be unfrozen whenever they like.
//	addDays      free when the reseller sets duration themselves, refused under
//	             days-per-GB where duration is not theirs to set.
//	subDays      refused outright.

//
//   - It moves totalGB and nothing else, so under days-per-GB a bulk top-up would
//     sell bytes and leave the deadline exactly where it was.
//   - It works per (inbound, email) TARGET, recomputing the new quota from each
//     membership's own settings entry, while the price is per ACCOUNT and was
//     quoted once. An account on three inbounds is charged for one gigabyte and,
//     left alone, is handed three, from three different starting points. Writing
//     the priced figure onto every membership makes applied and priced the same
//     number by construction, whatever the entries held before.
//
// A second pass rather than a change to BulkUpdateClients: that function serves
// every admin and knows nothing about resellers, and teaching it a per-account
// override for one role would put reseller policy in the middle of the path every
// admin takes.
//
// Memberships are resolved from what really serves the account, NOT from the join
// this used to be (inbounds against client_traffics.inbound_id). That join names
// the one inbound the account's single traffic row happens to point at, so the
// write-back landed on the home inbound and left every other membership holding
// the applier's own arithmetic.
//
// Both places have to move together. The settings blob is what the panel renders
// and what regenerates daemon config; client_traffics is what the expiry job and
// the daemons' own accounting read. Writing one without the other leaves the
// panel and the data plane disagreeing about when an account dies, so this runs
// in a single transaction and reports failure rather than half-applying.
