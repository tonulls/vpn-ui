// The projection: rendering an Account plus one AccountInbound membership back
// into the inbound's settings.clients entry.
//
// This is the single writer of settings.clients once the accounts layer is
// authoritative, and it exists so that EVERY other consumer can stay exactly as
// it is. RADIUS, the slot allocator, all eleven daemon config writers, the
// routing translator and GetXrayConfig parse settings.clients and none of them
// learn about accounts.
//
// Two rules make this safe on a live panel:
//
//  1. OVERLAY, NEVER REBUILD. Rendering starts from the membership's stored copy
//     of the original entry and writes only the keys the account layer owns. A
//     rebuild-from-modelled-fields would silently drop wg-c/awg per-device
//     keypairs (clients[].devices[], which model.Client does not model at all)
//     and GRE pinned peers, invalidating client configs already installed on
//     users' devices.
//  2. SPLICE IN PLACE, NEVER REORDER. An entry is matched by email and updated
//     where it sits. Position is load-bearing: an account with no explicit slot
//     falls back to its INDEX in clients[] (slotOr), so reordering or compacting
//     the array moves live sessions onto other accounts' tunnel addresses.

// accountOwnedKeys are the settings-JSON keys the account row is authoritative
// for. Everything else in an entry belongs to the membership or the protocol and
// is passed through untouched.
//
// Credential keys are deliberately NOT in this list: which of them an account
// owns depends on the protocol, so they are applied by applyAccountCredential.
