	//
	// But both egress through a paired Xray socks inbound whose USERNAME is the account
	// email, so Xray has usually already billed those exact bytes as a user stat in this
	// same tick. Appending unconditionally therefore hands addClientTraffic two records
	// measuring one transfer. That used to be masked by a `break` in addClientTraffic
	// that silently applied only the first record per email, which made the outcome
	// correct purely by append order: reordering these two lines would have doubled
	// every relay account's bill. addClientTraffic now SUMS per email, so the
	// de-duplication has to be explicit and it belongs here, at the point where the two
	// sources meet.
	//
	// The predicate is "does this account already have a record this tick", NOT "did it
	// move bytes this tick". The two sources flush on different boundaries: Xray can
	// report zero for an account whose bytes the relay has already tallied, and report

	// The relay counters remain a real fallback for an account Xray does not track at all
	// (no socks user, so no record in any tick), which is what those tallies exist for.
	//
	// Both relays now name their own inbound: telemt scrapes per inbound and the SSH
	// gateway counts per listener, so each record arrives already stamped. The stamp
	// below is the fallback for a record that still carries none, and it skips any
	// that does (see stampSourceInbound). SingleInboundIdByEmail returns 0 when two
