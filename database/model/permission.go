// Permission is a bitmask of what an admin may do, stored as an integer column on
// User. A super admin bypasses the mask entirely and is the only one who may
// manage other admins.
//
// The bitmask is a storage detail. Slugs (below) are what cross the wire to the
// API and the UI, so bits may be reordered freely but a slug rename is breaking.

	// PermOverviewManage turns the overview from a read-only showcase into a page
	// that can act. Seeing the overview used to be ungated (it was where a denial
	// redirects to), so before this bit existed anyone who could log in was offered
	// its whole management column and found out which parts they held by clicking
	// and reading the refusal.
	//
	// It scopes the overview's actions. This is intentionally powerful: the panel
	// update can replace the running binary as root, logs include other admins' data,
	// and database imports replace the store. Global config and full DB reads/exports
	// additionally require PermSensitiveExports, so overview management alone does
	// not expose stored credentials or password hashes. See the route gates in
	// web/controller/server.go before changing this boundary.
	//
	// APPENDED, for the reason above.
	PermOverviewManage
	// PermAccessOverview gates the overview page itself, which nothing gated before:
	// the overview is a HOST dashboard (kernel, CPU, disk, public IP, panel updates)
	// and an admin who only sells accounts has no business reading it.
	//
	// It stayed ungated only because deny() redirected every refusal to it, so gating
	// it would have looped. That is why this bit could not be added without a landing
	// page resolver first (see landingPath in web/controller/permission.go), which
	// sends a denial to the first page the caller can actually open and refuses
	// outright rather than redirecting when there is none.
	//
	// Deliberately NOT implied by PermOverviewManage, and it does not imply it
	// either: they are two answers ("may this page be opened", "may it act") and each
	// action behind the second still needs its own bit underneath.
	//
	// A reseller never holds this. Can() derives their whole mask from resellerPerms
	// and ignores the stored column, so their AllowOverview / AllowOverviewManage
	// profile booleans stay the source of truth for the role; the two columns are
	// resolved into one slug map for templates in web/controller/util.go.
	//
	// APPENDED, for the reason above.
	PermAccessOverview
	// PermSensitiveExports is a second, explicit gate for downloading the global
	// generated Xray config or SQLite database. It must be combined with the
	// overview-management grant; those exports contain credentials and password hashes.
	// APPENDED to preserve every mask already stored in the database.

// resellerPerms is what a reseller may do, derived from the role rather than

//
// Derived on purpose. A stored mask drifts: an ImportDB of a hand-edited backup,
// or one save path that forgets to clamp, leaves a reseller holding
// PermPanelSettings and nothing in the code notices. Deriving makes the role the
// single source of truth.
//
// Deliberately excludes every *Inbound bit: a reseller sells accounts on inbounds
// an admin assigned them, and creates none of its own.
//
// PermBulkOperation IS included, but it does not mean here what it means for an
// admin. The bulk routes are defined over "every client on this inbound", which
// for a reseller reaches accounts they do not own, so each one is separately
// scoped to their own accounts and priced against their balance
// (ResellerService.PrepareBulk). The two that cannot be scoped that way,
// resetAllTraffics and resetAllClientTraffics, stay refused in the controller.
// The bit is the door; it is not the authorization.
