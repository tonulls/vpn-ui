# vpn-ui management menu: the `vpn-ui` command.
#
# Installed to /usr/bin/vpn-ui by `vpn-ui-amd64 install-menu`, which deploy.sh runs
# on every fresh install and update. The script is EMBEDDED in the binary it
# drives, so the two are always the same release: upstream installs its menu by
# curling raw.githubusercontent at `main`, which pins the default branch's tip even
# on a box running a tagged release, and leaves the menu's numbering describing a
# binary that isn't there.
#
# The script never scrapes the binary's human output (upstream's
# `x-ui setting -show true | grep -Eo 'port: .+' | awk '{print $2}'` breaks the day
# someone rewords a line). Anything it only displays, the binary prints; anything
# it branches on comes from `vpn-ui-amd64 info --get <field>`, whose field names
# are a stable contract (see panelInfo in main.go). No jq required.
#
# It is also SOURCEABLE: deploy.sh sources this file purely to reuse
# obtain_letsencrypt_cert, so there is exactly ONE acme.sh implementation rather
# than two copies drifting apart. Everything below is a definition; the only code
# that runs is behind the sourced/executed guard at the very bottom. Keep it that
# way, or `source` will re-exec deploy.sh through sudo and drop it into a menu.
