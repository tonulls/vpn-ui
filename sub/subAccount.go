// One account is now served on SEVERAL inbounds at once: one email, one quota, one
// expiry, N memberships. Everything in this file exists because the subscription
// layer was written when that was impossible, so reads that were correct while an
// account meant a single inbound are wrong under it.
//
//   - client_traffics.Email is unique PANEL-WIDE, so an account served on three
//     inbounds has exactly ONE row, naming exactly one of them. The per-inbound
//     lookup answers with a ZERO VALUE for the other two.
//   - the header aggregation then folded those zeros in, and its rules are "any
//     member with total 0 makes the subscription unlimited" and "members whose
//     expiry disagrees means no expiry". Two zeros are therefore enough to turn a
//     100GB, 30-day account into "∞, never expires" in the client, while the
//     account really does expire and really does stop working, with nothing
//     anywhere saying why.
//   - genRemark reads the same per-inbound row for its Show Info suffix, so the one
//     membership that happened to own the row showed remaining traffic and days
//     and the others showed none, and a disabled account got its ⛔️N/A marker on
//     one node out of three.
//
// The fix is to resolve the identity ONCE per response and have every membership
// read that, which is what subScope does. It is gated on the accounts backfill
// having completed: before then settings.clients is the only truth, the accounts
// table may be empty or partial, and the legacy per-inbound path stays in charge.

// subScope is the per-RESPONSE state one subscription is rendered with.
//
// It is deliberately NOT kept on the shared SubService. The router builds exactly
// one SubService at start-up and every request is served by it (GetSubs already
// writes the caller's host onto that shared instance, so two subscribers fetching
// at once can be handed each other's address; SubService.forResponse closes that
// too). The state here is maps, and a concurrent map write panics the whole process
// rather than merely producing a wrong address, so it must never be shared.
